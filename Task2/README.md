# Tutorial Machine Learning in Solid Mechanics
For Task 2 'Hyperelasticity' the following files are important:
- data_np.py, data_tf.py: for data import => please adjust the path to your data
- plots_copy.py: Code for all plots
- model.py: Code for all models and for determining the inputs (invariants)
- main.ipynb: Notebook where the neural networks were trained and evaluated


For Task 3 'Viscoelasticity' the following files are important:
- data.py: Generation of data
- plots.py: Code for all plots
- model.py: Code for all models
- main.ipynb: Notebook where the neural networks were trained and evaluated
